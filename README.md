# Single cell biology project

This repo contains the full computational pipeline from the Single Cell Biology course. We were exploring the [Mouse cell atlas dataset](https://mouse.brain-map.org) by performing typical bioinformatics analysis - EDA, preprocessing, dimensionality reduction, clustering and DE analysis.

The whole pipeline is written in R based on Seurat package.
